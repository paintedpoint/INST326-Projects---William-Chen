Week 1
I needed some help coming up with ideas for my speech in INAG110. ChatGPT gave me some decent ideas but I still am not a fan of any of them. I'm probably not going to use any of it because it's a little too general. One of the major requirements are that I need to show some credibility on the topic. I believe that having some sort of personal connection would really help

I also had some trouble setting up a webcamera. As it turns out the setting was on Mirametrix Virtual Camera. I asked ChatGPT to tell me what it does. In the end, I decided to disable that camera as I'm also not using any of the accompanying features.

Week 2
I was a little stumped on what to write for my informative speech in INAG110. My professor had a template for us to fill out so I used that as a baseline for ChatGPT to help come up with ideas on. ChatGPT came up with some decent ideas I later used as a jumping off point.

I needed to relearn how to reiterate through python lists in a for loop. Asked ChatGPT to give the different ways. I actually quite like this and I have it saved for future reference.

Week 3
I needed some help for ideas for my speech introduction for INAG110. I didn't end up using any of them because I came up with something I think is really creative and is a lot more impactful

Week 4
I really needed some help with one of the questions. My code was returning an None and I was really confused. As it turns out, I was using the wrong thing to sort the dictionary pairs and even though I casted, it still didn't work. I ended up coming up with a solution to use the sorted (curtusy of ChatGPT) and a quick lambda (also with a refresher from ChatGPT).

Sometime during the week, I also used google sheets to compare some cells using a rule. I have no memory of the details but it looks like I got ChatGPT to write out most of it.
