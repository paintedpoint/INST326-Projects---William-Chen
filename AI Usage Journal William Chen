Week 1
I needed some help coming up with ideas for my speech in INAG110. ChatGPT gave me some decent ideas but I still am not a fan of any of them. I'm probably not going to use any of it because it's a little too general. One of the major requirements are that I need to show some credibility on the topic. I believe that having some sort of personal connection would really help

I also had some trouble setting up a webcamera. As it turns out the setting was on Mirametrix Virtual Camera. I asked ChatGPT to tell me what it does. In the end, I decided to disable that camera as I'm also not using any of the accompanying features.
